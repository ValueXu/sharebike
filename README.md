## About this project

The project is a mission from my teacher.
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
All data comes from [fastmoke.site](https://www.fastmoke.site) using my own key, also including [BaiduMap's Development Api](http://lbs.baidu.com/index.php?title=%E9%A6%96%E9%A1%B5).
I put the mock profiles in "/src/mock" folder, if you need it, configure it. You can use my mock apis just for development usage.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
You can use "serve" package in npm to start it.

### `yarn eject`

Actually I already ejected the project,  there's no use for this command.
